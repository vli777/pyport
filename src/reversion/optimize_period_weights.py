    Optimize the weight adjustment for mean reversion signals.

    The idea is to start with an equal-weight baseline allocation. The daily and weekly signals,
    which are continuous adjustment factors, are combined using a weight parameter.
    The combined signal is then normalized relative to the maximum observed signal value
    (using 1 as the baseline reference). This normalized signal is used to adjust the baseline allocation.
    The adjusted weights are normalized to sum to 1, and the strategy is simulated.

    Args:
        trial (optuna.trial.Trial): Optuna trial object.
        daily_signals_df (pd.DataFrame): Daily signals DataFrame.
        weekly_signals_df (pd.DataFrame): Weekly signals DataFrame.
        returns_df (pd.DataFrame): Log returns DataFrame.
